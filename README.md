## The Story Behind QuickCalc
When I first ventured into the world of open source, I faced significant challenges. The projects available on platforms like GitHub were often complex and high-end, making it difficult for a beginner like me to contribute effectively. I realized there was a need for simpler projects where individuals could test and improve their skills without feeling overwhelmed.

This realization led me to create QuickCalc. I wanted to develop a project that was both practical and accessible, serving as an entry point for beginners in open-source contributions. A calculator app seemed like the perfect choiceâ€”it's a fundamental tool that everyone understands and uses, and it doesn't require advanced programming knowledge to start working on.

QuickCalc isn't just a basic calculator; it's a learning platform. By making this project open source, I aim to provide a space where both beginners and advanced developers can collaborate, make mistakes, learn, and grow together. I believe that open source should be inclusive and supportive, offering opportunities for all skill levels to contribute and improve.

Now, QuickCalc is not only available on the Play Store but also open for contributions on GitHub. I hope this project will inspire others to start their journey in open source, just as it has inspired me to give back to the community that helped me grow.

By opening up QuickCalc to the world, I invite you to join me in this journey of learning and collaboration. Whether you're just starting out or you're an experienced developer, your contributions are valuable and welcome. Let's build something great together.

Thank you for being a part of this journey!
